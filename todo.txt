immediate::
0. make levels on the fly while playing (???)
  A. make other levels.
1. entity bug when moving entity offscreen and mouse leaves canvas
2. make enemies!!!
3. Edit entity context menu option
1. Create entity context menu option
	-select which entity to create??


-----------------------------------------------------------------eventual------------------------
1. node webkit map f12 to opening up console

2. Start designing/implementing levels/mechanics/glitches
	
3. Add key remapper for JUMP/LEFt/RIGHT/DOWN keys
	-input manager should treat keys and mouse keys as the same (for ease of remapping input)
	
4. Can fix tile faces thingy by having a sorter or something in the render function of room. (painter's algorith,?) (so player isn't rendered in front of tiles she is behind)

0. make loading screen that uses css gradient

5. advanced spellbook: pops up a console window of a fixed size with a limited scope (change namespace of the console to the room that you are in (e.g. game.level.room.entities -> entities)
	-further more (entities -> npc_alice, npc_chloe, swarm, grimoire)
	-player -> olivia (or player's name)
	
	example player spell:
		olivia.gravity = -1
		tree.update = function(){
			x++;	//todo how to make this work and not use the global namespace x, will have to parse
		}			//functions and ensure that the scope is using this.x instead!!??
	
6. could you save space by saving/loading the tiles by aggregate tile and reassembling original from the aggregation upon import?
